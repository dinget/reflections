When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to collaberate with others.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks = cloning github repository to own github
clones = getting repository to local device
branches = local commits

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Some commits may be a part of an unfinished feature. Automatic "pulls" may result in unfinished code being introduced leading to bugs.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Allows you to compare your own branches to the stored remote and merge them when ready to push your changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
You would have to manually send files to the poeple you are collaberating with. This would be slower and would be harder to do with many people as mistakes would be more likely.
