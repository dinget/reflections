When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to collaberate with others.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks = cloning github repository to own github
clones = getting repository to local device
branches = local commits

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Allows you to compare your own branches to the stored remote and merge them when ready to push your changes.
