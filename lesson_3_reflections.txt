When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to collaberate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Some commits may be a part of an unfinished feature. Automatic "pulls" may result in unfinished code being introduced leading to bugs.
