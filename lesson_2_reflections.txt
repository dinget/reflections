What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A hidden .git file is created which keeps track of commits. This has to be done in order to be able to save commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area contains the files that are going to be committed. It allows the user to choose which files are commited so that only the files involved in the current reasonable change are commited.
